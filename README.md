# Backpropagation Algorithm
Implementation of the Back-Propagation learning algorithm on a multi-layer neural networks,
which can be able to classify a stream of input data to one of a set of predefined classes.

Useing the iris data in both the training and testing processes.
(Each class has 50 samples: train NN with the first 30 non-repeated samples, and test it with the remaining 20 samples)
